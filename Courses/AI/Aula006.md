# Aula 6: Run AI Models with IBM Watson Studio

## Intrudução;

```
Objetivos:
	Descrever algoritmos de machine learning
	Para que serve o IBM watson studio
	features e beneficios do IBM watson studio (iws)


IBM watson stdio (iws):
	A collaborative data science and machine learning environment
	Easy visualizations with drag-and-drop code
	An efficient workflow
	A built-in neural network modeler
	Open-source tools such as Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio

iws: É uma IDE

Problem: None of the developers can agree on the order in which elements of the 
program should be developed. People sometimes finish their work only to learn, weeks later,
that another developer has introduced something new, sending them back for a do-over. 
Progress keeps slipping farther and farther behind schedule.

Solution: Efficient workflow
```

### FEATURES

1) Automated data preparation
2) Visual neural network design
3 Sophisticated analsis and prediction
4) Inified dashboard displays
